    <h1>Welcome to Shine & Sparkle</h1>
    <h2>Your trusted partner in having spotless homes and offices. We combine experience, professionalism, and we implement eco-friendly practices to deliver a sparkling clean indoor every time.</h2>
    <p>
        Shine & Sparkle began with a simple thought: a place so clean that it'll make your life brighter. 
        What started as a small family service dedicated to helping neighbors keep their homes spotless has now 
        grown into a trusted partner for both households and offices across Malaysia. Our journey has always been 
        guided with professionalism, dedication, and a commitment in using eco-friendly practices.
        <br></br>
        We believe that we create more than just clean rooms, we create environments where 
        people can feel comfortable, productive, and healthy overall. Our vision is to set the 
        standard for reliable, sustainable cleaning services in the current industry, while our 
        mission is to consistently deliver sparkling results through attention to detail, innovative methods, 
        and a team that truly cares about every space we clean.
